Based on io.js and Electron.

## Install packages

You will need node and build tools for your OS installed.
https://github.com/creationix/nvm seems to work well. Once installed, use `nvm install iojs`

`$ npm install`

## Build Electron package

`$ npm rebuild`

## Run Electron package

Since you're accessing raw sockets, you must run as root (eg sudo).

`$ npm start`

# Command line execution

`$ sudo bash`

`# node run-trace <host>`
